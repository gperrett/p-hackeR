### p-hacking by collecting additional data

Imagine you are running the hypothetical study on the effect of different music on perceived age, 40 participants complete the study and you begin to analyze the data. If your analyses is significant you write-up and report your results. If your results are insignificant you conclude it is because a sample size of 40 is too small and your study was under-powered. You resume data collection and gain an additional 20 participants. Now you re-run you analyses on all 60 participants. The decision to continue data collection after a result below .05 is a researcher degree of freedom. 

#### Run simulations: collecting additional data

Using the controls you can see the results form many independently ran studies, or the results of one study at a time. To see how how collecting additional data influences the false-positive rate, you can select the initial sample size as well as an amount to add to the initial sample if the first analysis is insignificant. p-hackeR will test the effect of music on perceived age using with the initial sample size, if results are insignificant, p-hackeR will add additional participants and then re-test the effect of music on perceived age.

Collect Data to see how likely a false positive is! Remember that without any p-hacking we would only expect a false postie 5% of the time. See how collecting additional data increases the false-positive rate.
